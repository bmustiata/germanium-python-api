Feature: Using germanium should be easy to right click, click or double click.
    When having a WebDriver object it's pretty tricky to do
    basic operations such as right click or click. For example
    clicking on an element can easily be done via `element
    .click()`, but for doing a right click it becomes necessary
    to create an ActionChain.
